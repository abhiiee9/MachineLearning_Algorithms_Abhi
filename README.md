# Machine Learning Algorithms - Abhi

This project includes five Python scripts where I implemented different machine learning algorithms using well-known datasets. The goal was to get hands-on experience with basic models, understand how they work, and practice good coding/documentation habits.

Each file contains:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing (if needed)
- Model training
- Prediction
- Accuracy evaluation

## Each Files and What They Do

### 1. `1_logistic_regression.py`
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Dataset**: Iris
- **Description**: Classifies iris flowers into 3 species using logistic regression.
- **Sample Output**:
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.9666


### 2. `2_decision_tree.py`
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree
- **Dataset**: Titanic (via seaborn)
- **Description**: Predicts survival based on class, age, and fare.
- **Sample Output**:
Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.75


### 3. `3_knn.py`
- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Dataset**: Digits
- **Description**: Classifies handwritten digits using KNN.
- **Sample Output**:
KNN Accuracy: 0.9888


### 4. `4_svm.py`
- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer
- **Description**: Predicts tumor type (malignant/benign).
- **Sample Output**:
SVM Accuracy: 0.9736


### 5. `5_random_forest.py`
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest
- **Dataset**: Wine
- **Description**: Classifies wine types based on chemical features.
- **Sample Output**:
Random Forest Accuracy: 1.0


## How to Run
These scripts can be run in Google Colab or any Python environment.  
Just make sure the required libraries are installed: pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn
